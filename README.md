# Laravel API (with sanctum authentication)

## What is sanctum?
[Laravel Sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sanctum#introduction) provides a featherweight authentication system for SPAs (single page applications), mobile applications, and simple, token based APIs. Sanctum allows each user of your application to generate multiple API tokens for their account. These tokens may be granted abilities or scopes which specify which actions the tokens are allowed to perform.
